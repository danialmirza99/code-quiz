## Description

In this assignment, I worked with Javascript, CSS, and HTML. In this program, the user is given a timed quiz. As the time goes on, the user has to answer various questions based on javascript. If the user gets the question correct they move on to the next question. If they get a question wrong, the time limit is deducted. At the end of the timer or quiz, the total score is compiled and returned.
